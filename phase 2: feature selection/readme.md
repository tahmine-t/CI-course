**Dataset Details:**

- **Source:** The SYN Digits Dataset is commonly used as a benchmark dataset for various machine learning and computer vision projects. The dataset contains a collection of images of handwritten digits, which are often used for tasks like digit recognition, classification, and image processing.

- **Contents:** The dataset includes a substantial number of grayscale images, each depicting a handwritten digit from 0 to 9. These images serve as the primary data for your feature selection and classification tasks in this project.

- **Format:** Images in the SYN dataset are typically stored as pixel values in a matrix format, making them suitable for training and testing machine learning models.

The SYN dataset is a popular choice for practicing feature selection, image classification, and other machine learning tasks. You can find more information and resources related to this dataset in the project instructions provided in [CI - Spring 2023-Phase3.pdf](link-to-instructions-pdf).

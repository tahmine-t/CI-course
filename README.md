Overview
This repository contains two phases of a Computational Intelliegence project: Multi-Domain Classification and Feature Selection. The project aims to explore multi-domain classification of digits and apply feature selection techniques to enhance model performance.

Phase 1: Multi-Domain Classification
In Phase 1, we worked on classifying digits from the SYN Digits Dataset, a dataset consisting of images of handwritten digits. The task was extended to multi-domain classification, where we performed classification not only on digits but also on domains of the dataset. This challenge tested the ability to adapt models for more complex real-world scenarios involving noisy data and domain variations.

Phase 2: Feature Selection
In Phase 2, the focus shifted to feature selection, a crucial step in improving model performance by selecting the most relevant features. The goal was to identify the best features for the classification task and assess how feature selection can impact accuracy, reduce overfitting, and improve computational efficiency.
